# NER-Kannada
Named Entity Recognition for data in Kannada Language


The Project modules

* Crawler  ==> Kannada-NER/Crawler
Module to extract wikipedia articles from web

* Neural Network based NER System

  Pre Processing:
    Module to process raw data and generate input files for traning neural network

  NER Models: 
  1) In - Input Files for Neural Networks
  2) out- Output Files of neural network 
  3) src - Modules for training and prediction using neural networks
  4) trained_model - Neural Network NER model files

To run, NER_NN/ner_modal/src -> python execute.py
